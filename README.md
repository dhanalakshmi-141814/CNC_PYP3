 Simple file reading and writing  
 Punctuation removal and case normalization  
 Accurate word frequency counter  
 Alphabetically sorted output  
 Uses Python's built-in `pathlib` and `string` modules (no external libraries)

##  Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- `pathlib` for file handling
- `string` module for cleaning punctuation
